SPEAKER_00 [0.00 - 3.00]: The Jerogan experience.
SPEAKER_00 [3.00 - 10.00]: So, how, after the case is closed, what is life like for you?
SPEAKER_00 [10.00 - 15.00]: Like, how do you, I mean, you had to be worried about your life?
SPEAKER_01 [15.00 - 25.00]: Yeah, well, what happened is once they found out the commission put a $500,000 contract on me.
SPEAKER_01 [26.00 - 39.00]: And the New York office of the FBI went to every boss and told them they better not think of, you know, trying to cash in on it.
SPEAKER_01 [39.00 - 53.00]: So, I was working out of Washington and out of Quantico and family's moved.
SPEAKER_00 [53.00 - 58.00]: I think we got like five or six moves since then, you know, you try to back everything.
SPEAKER_01 [58.00 - 64.00]: The Bureau was good about that.
SPEAKER_01 [64.00 - 74.00]: But, you know, what's in the back of your mind is not the legitimate gangster.
SPEAKER_00 [74.00 - 78.00]: You know, it's some cowboy that thinks, hey, you know, God, I think.
SPEAKER_00 [78.00 - 82.00]: Yeah, there's not any brass coal, you know, if I take him out, we're in.
SPEAKER_00 [82.00 - 83.00]: Right.
SPEAKER_00 [83.00 - 90.00]: Which, and I don't think anybody was going to pay anybody 500,000.
SPEAKER_00 [90.00 - 96.00]: You think the mob is, they don't use their old money for, you know, for squat.
SPEAKER_01 [96.00 - 98.00]: So, yeah.
SPEAKER_00 [98.00 - 104.00]: But that's the only thing that you worry about is, you know, some cowboy, you know.
SPEAKER_00 [104.00 - 109.00]: How long was it before you stopped worrying about that?
SPEAKER_01 [109.00 - 111.00]: Well, you never really do.
SPEAKER_00 [111.00 - 121.00]: I mean, you know, you know, yeah, yeah, you know, because there's always somebody that thinks
SPEAKER_01 [121.00 - 125.00]: they're, you know, they're going to be famous about doing something.
SPEAKER_00 [125.00 - 126.00]: Right.
